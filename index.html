David Orobosa Omoregie was born on 5 June 1998 in Angell Town, in the Brixton area of South London, to Nigerian parents from the Edo ethnic group.[6] His father, Frank Omoregie, a pastor and his mother, Juliet Doris Omoregie, a nurse.[7] He has two older brothers, Benjamin and Christopher, who are eight and five years older than him respectively.[8] Dave's father was deported to Nigeria when Dave was just a few months old due to visa issues; he had believed he was travelling on a missionary visa but was actually on a visitor's visa.[9][10] Dave's mother had to flee with his brothers due to fear of deportation herself and was not reunited with Dave until three months later. The family was then left homeless for a period and had to make a home on South London's buses.[7][11]

Dave moved to Streatham, South London from nearby Brixton at the age of 7.[12] He began composing music at an early age; he started writing lyrics at 11 after watching his older brother practise rapping at home and he taught himself piano after his mother got him an electric keyboard for Christmas when he was 14.[13] Both of Dave's older brothers were in prison throughout his teenage years. When Dave was 11, his brother Christopher, who is currently still in prison, was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum of 18 years, under the law of joint enterprise, for his involvement in the March 2010 gang murder of 15-year-old Sofyen Belamouadden at London Victoria station.[14][15] Then in 2014, when Dave was 15, his other brother Benjamin went to prison for four years for robbery, he was released in 2018.[16][17]

Dave attended St Mark's Academy in Mitcham, and Richmond upon Thames College in Twickenham, where he studied law, philosophy, ethics, while also completing an additional module in sound design and politics. He secured a place at De Montfort University in Leicester to study law but never attended, choosing instead to focus on his musical career.[18] Dave is also an avid supporter of Manchester United F.C.[19]
